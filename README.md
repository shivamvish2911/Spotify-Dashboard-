üìå Problem Statement

From the screens, the key problems solved are:
No clear KPI monitoring ‚Üí Dashboard provides quick summary of total songs, artists, popularity, duration, etc.
Lack of explicit vs non-explicit analysis ‚Üí Users can compare how explicit songs perform vs non-explicit.
Difficulty in tracking song/album distribution ‚Üí Visuals show breakdown by album type and release year.
Trend visibility missing ‚Üí Popularity and distinct songs trends are shown over time (monthly & yearly).
Artist vs Song level insights not connected ‚Üí Drill-down pages for Artists and Songs connect overview insights to detailed records.
Decision-making gaps ‚Üí Marketing and curation teams can now identify which artists/songs to promote, trends to follow, and which content resonates with audiences.
